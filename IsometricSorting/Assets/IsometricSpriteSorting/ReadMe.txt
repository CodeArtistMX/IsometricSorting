/// How to use this asset:
- Go to Window, and at the very bottom press "Isometric Sprite Sorting", this will open up the editor tool. (You can dock it to your window layout)
- Once you are happy with your current sprite placement select the appropiate Layer and press the "Sort Sprites" button. 
- After that, for all the dynamic sprites (The ones that will be moving through the world), drag and drop the component "Isometric Sprite".
- Repeat this process as necessary.

Feel free to change the code to whatever you please.
You can also delete (or modify) everything in the DemoExtras, is not necessary for the sprite sorter.
